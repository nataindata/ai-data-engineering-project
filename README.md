# AI Data Engineering Project for Beginners 🦜⛓️
AI Data Engineering project for beginners: Create your AI Data assistant with Data BigQuery + LangChain + VertexAI

This hands-on tutorial will show you how you can add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using LangChain and LLMs on Google Cloud. We will build together a sample Python application that will be able to understand and respond to human language queries about the relational data stored in your Data warehouse.

🏆 This could be a great feature if you want to enable/showcase to your management how to talk to the data in a natural way and make their life easier.

🦾 It's basically creating your own AI Data assistant

## The goal:
Build a new AI-powered data chatbot, where users can describe their needs in simple English text, along with regular filters (like price, etc.)
To add new generative AI experiences in their data warehouse for business stakeholders.
Dataset: This notebook uses an example of TheLook data - a fictitious eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team.

The dataset for this notebook has been sampled and created from a larger public retail dataset available at Bigquery `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.inventory_items`.
